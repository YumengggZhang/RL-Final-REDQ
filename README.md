# RL-Final-REDQ
Course project: Reinforcement Learning


This report investigated the performance of REDQ Chen et al. (2021) with five different trained variants on two MoJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012; Brockman et al., 2016) environments: HalfCheetah and Hopper. Six REDQ variants are trained to aim at investigating the following aspects of model training: 1)Training data steps 2)Action noise in evaluation phrase 3)Network structure - deeper network & more parameters
